StoodJarguar6577 has coded a bot on his youtube channel playing Forza Horizon 5. I analyzed his videos and uploaded what he wrote.

if you want to try the "good" one (the one he made on youtube). then you should run main.py

Sure, I can help you with that. Here is a possible description for your project:

Python plays Forza Horizon 5 is a project that uses Python to create a bot that can drive in Forza Horizon 5, a popular racing video game. The project uses a plugin called vgamepad to simulate a controller and the only thing it can look at is the mini map. It is not an AI, it is just a simple bot that follows some rules. The main.py file contains the code for the bot and the vgamepad plugin.
